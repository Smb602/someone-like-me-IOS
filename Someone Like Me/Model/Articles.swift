var articleBodyArray = ["There are two different kinds of pain we can experience: acute pain and chronic pain. Acute pain is the pain you get after you bang your knee, have an operation or a heart attack. It lasts for a limited period of time and usually responds well to medication. Chronic pain is pain which persists or recurs for more than three months. It is now recognised as a condition in its own right. It may be pain related to another condition (such as rheumatoid arthtritis or diabetes). It may be pain from an injury or operation which continues after healing would normally take place. It may have no detectable cause in injury, illness or operation. Understanding the causes of pain can be an important step towards learning to self-manage your own pain, helping to reduce concern and to make you feel more confident about movement. It is also important for health professionals, families and friends of people with pain and the wider public to learn more about pain so that together we can improve the levels of understanding and support people living with pain receive. \n\n\nYou can call the Pain Concern Helpline on 0300 123 0789, every Monday, Thursday and Friday 10-12 and 14-16.",
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        "1. Track your pain level and activities every day. To effectively treat your pain, your doctor needs to know how you've been feeling between visits. Keeping a log or journal of your daily 'pain score' will help you track your pain. At the end of each day, note your pain level on the 1 to 10 pain scale. Also, note what activities you did that day.\n2. Reduce stress in your life. Stress Negative feelings like depression, anxiety, stress, and anger can increase the body's sensitivity to pain. By learning to take control of stress, you may find some relief from chronic pain. Several techniques can help reduce stress and promote relaxation. Listening to soothing, calming music can lift your mood.\n3. Boost chronic pain relief with the natural endorphins from exercise.Endorphins are brain chemicals that help improve your mood while also blocking pain signals. Exercise has another pain-reducing effect -- it strengthens muscles, helping prevent re-injury and further pain.\n4. Cut back on alcohol, which can worsen sleep problems. Pain makes sleep difficult, and alcohol can make sleep problems worse. If you're living with chronic pain, drinking less or no alcohol can improve your quality of life.\n5. Join a support group. Meet others living with chronic pain. When you're with people who have chronic pain, and understand what you're going through, you feel less alone.  Also, consider meeting with a mental health professional. Anyone can develop depression if he or she is living with chronic pain. Getting counselling can help you learn to cope better and help you avoid negative thoughts that make pain worse. Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n. Don't smoke. It can worsen chronic pain. Smoking can worsen painful circulation problems and increase risk of heart disease and cancer.\n7. Learn deep breathing or meditation to help you relax. Deep breathing and meditation are techniques that help your body relax, which may ease pain. Deep breathing is also a relaxation technique. Find a quiet location, a comfortable body position, and block out distracting thoughts. Then, imagine a spot just below your navel. Breathe into that spot, filling your abdomen with air. Let the air fill you from the abdomen up, then let it out, like deflating a balloon.\n8. Get a massage for chronic pain relief. Massage can help reduce stress and relieve tension and is being used by people living with all sorts of chronic pain, including back and neck pain.\n9. Eat a healthy diet if you're living with chronic pain. A well-balanced diet is important in many ways; aiding your digestive process, reducing heart disease risk, keeping weight under control, and improving blood sugar levels. To eat a low-fat, low-sodium diet, choose from these: fresh fruits and vegetables; cooked dried beans and peas; whole-grain breads and cereals; low-fat cheese, milk, and yogurt; and lean meats.\n10. Find ways to distract yourself from pain so you enjoy life more. When you focus on pain, it makes it worse rather than better. Instead, find something you like doing, an activity that keeps you busy and thinking about things besides your pain. You might not be able to avoid pain, but you can take control of your life.

                        "Addictive Pain Medications: Opioids, a family of drugs that have effects similar to those of opium or morphine, can be addictive. \nWho Is at Risk for Addiction? Most people who take their pain medicine as directed by their doctor do not become addicted, even if they take the medicine for a long time. However, some people may be at a higher risk of becoming addicted than others. People who have been addicted to substances in the past or those with a family member who is or has been addicted to drugs or alcohol may be at increased risk of becoming addicted to narcotics. \nHow to Prevent Addiction: The key to avoiding addiction is to take your medicine exactly as your doctor prescribes. Share with your doctor any personal and/or family history of substance abuse or addiction. Your doctor needs this information to prescribe the medicines that will work best for you. Fears about addiction should not prevent you from using narcotics to effectively relieve your pain. Remember, it is common for people to develop a tolerance to their pain medication and to need higher doses to achieve the same level of pain relief. Such a situation is normal and is not a sign of addiction. However, you should talk to your doctor if this effect becomes troubling. \nWebMD Medical Reference Reviewed by Smitha Bhandari, MD on January 22, 2018"]
